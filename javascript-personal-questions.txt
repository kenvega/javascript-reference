when creating an object, can I refer to the same object?

what is considered falsy in javascript?
  false, undefined, 0, null, what else?
  objects? arrays? probably a reference could help

  this question comes because i saw this
    const availableMenuItems = menuItems.filter(menuItem => menuItem);


why this works?

  const arr = [1, 2, 3]
  arr.forEach(console.log) // this will print some numbers.. although not exactly 1, 2, 3
                           // but how.. i didn't pass any params nor invoked the function

  arr.forEach(e => {console.log(e)})
